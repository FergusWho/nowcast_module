# nowcast_module

This is a version customized for the CCMC production server, with the following differences:
- Code and simulations are now in separate folders: code in `/shared/iPATH/nowcast_module_v1`, simulations in `/data/iPATH/nowcast_module_v1`.
- Katie's `operational-sep` output files are created directly in the `path_output/transport/json` folder of each simulation.
- All Bash scripts now set the environment at the beginning via `set_environment.sh`, thus absolute paths for Python, Slurm, and MPI commands were removed.
- ZEUS jobs use the `ondemand-m5n` queue, while iPATH jobs use the `ondemand-c6i` queue and 128 cores.
- Date and time formats used for folder and file names were changed: `yyyy-mm-dd_HH:MM` → `yyyymmdd_HHMM`, `yyyy-mm-dd` → `yyyymmdd`, and `yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS` → `yyyymmddTHHMMSS`.
- Simulation type (`CME` or `Flare`) and observer (`earth`, `mars`, etc) are always added to file and folder names.
- Unused Python and Bash scripts were removed.
- Added `setup.sh` script to install the `crontab` file and create the hierarchy of simulation output folders. Similar setup scripts were added to the `ipath_v2` and `operational-sep_v3` repos, in their `rt-hpc-prod` branch.
- Added the scrit `cp2staging.sh` to copy relevant output files to the staging areas for iSWA and the SEP Scoreboard.
- More cleanup:
    - First 30 `ZEUS` dump files are deleted.
    - Slurm log files are gzipped.
    - CME animation frames (`png` files) are deleted, after checking for the corresponding `gif` correctedness.
    - All CME acceleration `dat` files not copied to iSWA are gzipped.
- Improved logging:
    - Each `cron` cycle uses a different log file: `/data/iPATH/nowcast_module_v1/cron/<type>/<yyyymmdd_HHMM>.log`, where `<type>` is `Background`, `CME`, or `Flare`.
    - All output, except last line, from `check_CME.py` and `check_flare.py` is redirected to stderr, so it is added to the logfile.
    - Moved all output generated by commands and scripts after the creation of the simulation folder from the `cron` log to each simulation `log.txt` file.
    - Added timestamps to most log lines.
    - Slurm ZEUS logfiles are saved inside each simulation folder.
    - Slurm iPATH logfiles are saved in the corresponding `path_output/transport` folder of each simulation.
